# yaghn: Yet Another GitHub Notifier

I wanted something simpler than https://github.com/sindresorhus/GitHub-Notifier.
No unread count, just a binary indicator for unread notifications.

## TODO

- [x] ~~Two icons that don't suck.~~ Found some decent icons from wiki commons.
- [x] ~~Don't open in a new tab if there's already a notifications tab open.~~
